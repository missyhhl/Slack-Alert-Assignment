/*
Data issue: There are four apps (id=10,11,17,31) having more clicks than impressions. 


-- Potential causes and ways to verify:
  - Tracking issue: Some impressions are not properly tracked. [Check the tracking setup for the alerts that have clicks but no impressions]
  - Data refresh/upload issue: Some impressions data are not refreshed or uploaded into this data set as this data set contains user behaviors on a Sunday. [Refresh and ensure data is complete]
  - One-day data set: This data set only contains data logged on 4/10/2016, therefore events happened right before or after 12AM are not included. One alert can be seen the day before, and be clicked on during this day. [Look at a longer timeframe]
  - Different time zones: The time zone used for extracting this data set can be different from the time zone where the users were. some events happened in 1 day could be broken out into 2 days. [Analyze the data based on users’ local timezone]


-- Solution for conducting the analysis below:
  - Exclude data from these four apps

/*** Questions #1 What is the best performing alert type? ***/


/*
I define the “best performing” alert type as the one that the users engage with (i.e. clicked on) the most. 


By this definition, Sidebar Alert is the best performing alert type for this given day based on the following analysis results.


-- Users are more likely to click on sidebar alerts. 
  - Sidebar Alert has the highest click-through rate (61%; from impression to click) among the three alert types even with the highest number of impressions and clicks. 


-- Sidebar alert engages with more teams and users.
  - The number of teams and users clicked on sidebar alerts (790 or 38% of total teams; 1808 or 39% of total users) are the highest.

/*** Questions #2 What apps are the best and worst performing? ***/


/*
I define the “best performing” app as the app that contributed the most to overall engagement (measured by click-through rate), and the “worst performing” app as the app that contributed the least to overall engagement. 


By these definitions, app #4 is the best performing one, and the app with id #15 as the worst performing one.


Specific analysis results are as follows:
-- App #4 contributed 11% to overall CTR, and it’s the mostly used app among teams (415 or 34% of total teams), and the second mostly used app among users (801 or 24% total users).
-- App #15 is used by a large number of users (35% of total users) with the highest impressions but 0 click. Therefore, it is the worst performing app in terms of contribution to overall engagement. However, it can be a well-performing app if its purpose or goal is simply to reach or inform people, rather than engage.
